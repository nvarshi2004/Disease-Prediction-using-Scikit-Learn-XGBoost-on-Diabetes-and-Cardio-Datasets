# Machine Learning Classification Using Scikit-Learn

## ****Project Overview****


This project focuses on building and training classification models using Scikit-Learn. It explores various machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, for prediction tasks. The project includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation techniques to improve classification accuracy.

## **Dataset**


The dataset used in this project contains real-world data related to cardiovascular disease prediction.
Features include age, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and lifestyle habits.
The target variable (cardio) indicates whether a person has cardiovascular disease (1) or not (0).

## **Technologies & Libraries Used**


Python

Scikit-Learn (for model training)

XGBoost (for boosting performance)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

## **Project Steps**


Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, applied feature encoding, and performed feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used visualizations to understand feature distributions and correlations.

Model Training: Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: Used accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.

User Input Prediction: Allowed users to input their details and predict if they have cardiovascular disease.
